Spatial Awareness - Spatial Data Platform Backend
Spatial Awareness is a geospatial data platform built using FastAPI and PostGIS, designed to handle point and polygon spatial data. It provides powerful REST APIs to perform spatial operations such as containment and proximity queries.

üöÄ Features
CRUD APIs for:


Multiple Points (e.g., farm plots, sensors, dealers)


Multiple Polygons (e.g., geofences, zones)


Spatial queries:


‚úÖ Get all points within a polygon


‚úÖ Get all polygons containing a point


‚úÖ Get all points within a radius (proximity search)


Swagger documentation for easy testing


Dockerized setup with persistent PostGIS database



üåç Real-World Scenarios Demonstrated
üõ°Ô∏è HAL Zone Defense Check
Polygon: HAL Zone (Defense area)


Points: 3 farm plots


Objective: Check whether any farm encroaches on the restricted zone using ST_Contains


üè™ Jayanagar 4th Block Market Optimization
Polygon: Market zone


Points: 4 vegetable bulk dealers


Objective: Help vendors choose the nearest dealer using ST_DWithin and visualize dealer locations inside the market boundary
